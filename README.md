Employee office status

This program was written as an employee sign in / sign out system so that employees could mark themselves either in the office or out of the office.  It was written using Python 2.7

It uses text files to initialize and to keep track of history.  When an employee is leaving the office he or she would simply fill in the relavent input boxes and then click the Out button.  There is a function that will try and match a name to the local computer name and move that person to the top of the list.  If you click on an employee button then it will give you additional info about the employee like phone extension and phone number.
